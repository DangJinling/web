RMUIF is short for [React](https://reactjs.org), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), the three musketeers that make up this template. With [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) at its core, you can expect the same tooling to work out of the box. The starting app is essentially a supercharged version of CRA, with all the bells and whistles.

## Features

- Bootstrapped with Create React App
- Google’s [Material Design](https://material.io) through Material-UI
- Firebase back-end with most of their products for the web included, e.g., [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
- Routing with [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web), including protected routes and error handling
- Extensive and well-tested mobile support with full-screen dialogs and swipeable tabs
- Cross-platform application monitoring with [Sentry](https://sentry.io)

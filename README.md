# RMUIF

RMUIF is the acronym for [React](https://reactjs.org) [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) which are the three musketeers that make up this template.
With [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) at its core you can expect the same tooling to work out of the box, it is essentially a ”supercharged“ version of CRA with all the bells and whistles.

## Features

There are lots of features included in the template, some of the most prominent are:

- Bootstrapped with Create React App, the same tooling works from the get-go
- UI scaffolding incorporates Google’s Material Design through Material-UI
- Built on top of Firebase with all their products for the web included
- Robust routing with React Router including protected routes and error handling
- Extensive mobile support with full-screen dialogs and react-swipeable-views for tabs
- Cross-platform application monitoring with a focus on error reporting with Sentry

The list goes on and on, but what really stands out are these unique features:

- Upload an image as avatar
- Manage profiles with fields like first and last names
- Synchronize the app’s theme on all devices signed in to an account
- Change the password for an account

As you will see, there are a lot more features and more is included in every release.
Your project can take advantage of new releases by configuring Git to use this repository as an upstream origin.
You can learn more about this later.
